# Computer-Vision-Project
The aim of the project is to find the 10 templates with the best matching among 250 different
positions of an object and 10 test images. The experiment is repeated using 3 different objects,
each one associated with 10 different test images. To achieve the aim, 250 different views of each
object are given (with their corresponding mask).
